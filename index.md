## Introduction
I am a third year Computer Science student studying here at UC San Diego. I was born in India, but grew up in Fremont, CA almost my entire life. Here are a couple more things about me:
-  I love watching sports. My favorite sport teams are the **Golden State Warriors** and the **San Francisco 49ers**. I also keep up to date with track and field news, especially the sprinting events
-  I only use one form of social media, and that is [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) 
-  In my free time, I love to walk or jog on the trails in my hometown
   - My frequent choice of trails are the ones in **Coyote Hills**
-  I have to listen to music when I'm practically doing *anything* (even studying!)
   - My favorite genre is **Hip-Hop/R&B** and my favorite artists include **Smino**, **Isaiah Rashad**, **Kid Cudi**, **Frank Ocean**, and **Young Thug**
   - I also love to listen to older music from time to time including artists like **Elton John**, the **Beatles**, and **Prince**
     - My favorite song from Elton John is [Don't Go Breaking My Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0qW9P-uYfM)

## Some Other Stuff About Me
- My favorite quote is that from George Carlin:

  > Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?
- To this day, I have not tried anything that pleases my tastebuds more than the **Spicy Deluxe** from Chick-fil-a
- Over quarantine, I developed a web application as a personal project that searches for available food choices and plots their locations on a map
  - To play with the app in Docker, run `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name foodbox-app hbattu/foodbox`
  - To stop the app, run `docker stop foodbox-app`
  - I also hosted the app using an [AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance](http://foodbox-env-2.eba-8tsswabp.us-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
